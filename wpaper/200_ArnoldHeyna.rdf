Title:"Low-Wage Competition: Pains From Trade for Medium-Wage Countries"
	
Abstract: The entry of a low-wage country into a world economy with pre-existing
wage differentials puts the gains from trade in a former low-wage and then
medium-wage country under pressure. If negotiations over the formation of
a free trade area cover international transfers, there is a strong presumption
that they bring about global free trade and compensation of the mediumwage
country if necessary. In the absence of international transfers, by contrast,
the medium-wage country is not compensated when global free trade
causes a reduction in its gains from trade, and it may even happen that it
is not part of the equilibrium free trade area.
