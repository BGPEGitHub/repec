Title: Does Information about Inequality and Discrimination in Early Child Care Affect Policy Preferences?
	
Abstract: We quantify the economic impact of a potential secession of Catalonia from Spain.
Using a novel dataset of trade flows between 17 Spanish sub-national regions and 142
countries, we estimate the effects of different levels of borders on trade flows and un-
cover heterogeneity in country-to-country, region-to-country, region-to-region, and
EU border effects. We use a general equilibrium analysis to understand the con-
sequences of a potential Catalan secession, considering the associated political un-
certainty. In counterfactual experiments, we impose new borders on Catalan trade,
potentially within or outside the EU, resulting in a welfare decline for Catalonia and
the remaining Spanish regions.
