Title: Are Wages Equal Across Sectors of Production? A Panel Data Analysis for Tradable and Non-Tradable Goods
	
Abstract: The assumption that national labor markets are homogenous across tradable and
non-tradable goods is common in multisector (open-economy) macro models and
crucial for the prominent Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis. This study tests it with
a novel method to distinguish the tradable and non-tradable sectors grounded in
economic theory, modern empirical methods and a large and detailed macro data set.
It nds that both the internal relationship between productivity and wages in the
tradable and non-tradable sectors postulated by the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis
and its external transmission mechanism are rejected.
