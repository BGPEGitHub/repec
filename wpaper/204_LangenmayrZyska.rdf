Title: Avoiding Taxes: Escaping the Exchange of Information: Tax Evasion via Citizenship-by-Investment
	
Abstract: With (automatic) exchange of tax information among countries now common,
tax evaders have had to find new ways to hide their offshore holdings. One such
way are citizenship-by-investment programs, which offer foreigners a new passport
for a local investment or a fixed fee. We show analytically that high-income
individuals acquire a new citizenship to lower the probability that their tax evasion
is detected through information exchange. Using data on cross-border bank
deposits, we find that deposits in tax havens increase after a country starts offering
a citizenship-by-investment program, providing indirect evidence that tax
evaders use these programs.
