Title: The Productivity Effect of Non-Union Representation
	
Abstract: Declining union density in many industrialized countries directs attention to alter-
native ways of labor relations and worker representation as, e.g., works councils.
German works councils belong to the most powerful worker representations in de-
veloped countries but little is known of their causal effect on productivity. A large
linked employer-employee panel is used to examine this issue. Comparing firms
with and without a works council I find that firms with a works council are on
average 6.5 percent more productive. I present evidence that this estimate is the
lower bound to the causal productivity effect of works councils.
