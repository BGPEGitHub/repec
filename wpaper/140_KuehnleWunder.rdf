Title: The effects of smoking bans on self-assessed health: evidence from Germany

	
Abstract: The 16 German federal states introduced smoking bans on different dates during 2007 and
2008. These bans restricted smoking in enclosed public places, particularly in restaurants and
bars. This study examines the effects of smoking bans on self-assessed health. Using data from
the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), difference-in-differences estimations provide evidence for
health improvements for the population at large. Health benefits from the secondhand smokefree
environment are equivalent to an increase in household income of approximately 30%. Further
subgroup analyses show that health improvements are largest among young non-smokers
(below 30 years) whereas smokers report no or even adverse health effects in response to bans.
Exploiting differences in the dates of introduction and enforcement, we find no evidence that
the effects of bans depend on enforcement measures.
