Title: Is Rational Speculation in the Presence of Positive Feedback Traders Destabilizing?
	
Abstract: DeLong (1990a) et al. show that in the presence of positive feedback traders rational speculation
can be destabilizing, in that it drives the price of a risky asset above its expected value. A
generalization of their seminal model with additional trading dates and an additional informative
signal yields further interesting insights: it helps clarify when prices overreact, underreact, or
even move in the "wrong" direction; when rational speculation is destabilizing or stabilizing; and
whether overreaction is a symptom of market inefficiency or a manifestation of informational
efficiency.
