Title: Taxing Transitions: Inheritance Tax
and Family Firm Succession
	
Abstract: In many OECD countries, family firms face lower or no succession taxes if
they fulfill continuation requirements. We study the effects of such preferential treat-
ment in a two-generation model. Preferential treatment of continued firms leads to
more entrepreneurship and higher wages, as entrepreneurs invest more as they value
passing on a larger firm. However, more low-ability heirs continue the firm, leading to
efficiency losses. In the presence of financial frictions, richer (but less able) heirs may
invest more than buyers from outside.
