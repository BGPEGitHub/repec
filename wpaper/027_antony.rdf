Title: Depletion of Non-Renewable Resources and Endogenous Technical Change

Abstract: Non-renewable resources are an obstacle for positive long run growth if they
are essential for production, households solve an intertemporal Ramsey problem
and population is growing. Modern growth models predict that growth is
positively related to growth in production factors. Hence, there are opposing
forces at work if labor as one factor is growing and the use of the non-renewable
resource as another factor is shrinking. The paper develops a semi-endogenous
growth model with one labor and one resource using sector and derives conditions
for stable positive long run growth in per capita production and consumption.
