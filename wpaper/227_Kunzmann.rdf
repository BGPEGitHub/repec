Title: Estimating Regime Dependent Fiscal Spillover Effects in a Monetary Union
	
Abstract: I estimate regime-dependent spillover effects from government spending shocks across the
members of the European Monetary Union (EMU). I use panel regressions for a total of 14 EMU
economies from 1997 to 2022. Government spending shocks are defined by unexpected innovations
to forecast predictions of government purchases, similar to Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013).
However, In contrast to business cycle dependence, I investigate the quantitative impact of
different fiscal policy regimes of the targeted country, the country of origin, and the monetary
union on the spillover multipliers. Thereby, I allow fiscal and monetary policy to follow a two-
state Markov Switching process characterizing an active and a passive regime as in Leeper (1991).
Thus, governments differ in their debt reduction efforts to satisfy their budget constraint and
monetary policy varies between inflation targeting and restrained price level determination. I find
that spillover multipliers are highly regime-dependent, with positive and significant effects when
the targeted country is active and the country of origin is passive. These effects are consistent but
even larger for members with a high level of debt. However, results suggest that the importance
of union-wide fiscal behavior and that of the central bank matters more for highly indebted
countries. Thus, the interest rate channel is gaining relevance when debt is high. (JEL: F41;F42;F45; E62; C23)
