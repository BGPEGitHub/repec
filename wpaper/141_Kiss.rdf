Title: The impact of peer achievement and peer heterogeneity on own achievement growth: Evidence from school transitions

Abstract: This paper estimates ability peer effects on achievement growth in reading and
math. It exploits variation in peer characteristics generated at the transition from
primary to secondary school in a sample of Berlin fifth-graders. As will be discussed
in detail, this variation is exogenous in large parts. Results are similar for both
achievement measures: pupils benefit from abler peers, but high-achievers do so to
a smaller extent. The estimated impact of the variance in peer skills is negative,
but insignificant.
