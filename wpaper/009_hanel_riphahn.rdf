Title: Financial Incentives and the Timing of Retirement: Evidence from Switzerland
Abstract: We use reforms in the Swiss public retirement system to identify the responsiveness of
retirement timing to financial incentives. A permanent reduction of retirement benefits by 3.4
percent induces more than 70 percent of females to postpone their retirement. The
responsiveness of male workers, who undergo a different treatment, is lower.
