Title: 	Unionisation triggers tax incentives to attract foreign direct investment
	
Abstract: This paper analyses tax competition between a unionised and a non-unionised
country for the location of an outside firm. We show that unionisation offers an
extra incentive for the government to attract a foreign competitor to a concen-
trated domestic market, in order to affect the behaviour of the domestic union.
This results in the unionised country's government offering a tax discount (or a
subsidy premium) to the outside firm in excess of what is needed to compensate
the investor for the higher union wage. In equilibrium, therefore, the unionised
country can attract the outside firm even if it has other location disadvantages,
such as a smaller home market.
