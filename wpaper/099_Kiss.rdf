Title: Are Immigrants and Girls Graded Worse? Results of a Matching Approach

	
Abstract: Using PIRLS 2001 and PISA 2003 data for Germany, this paper examines whether secondgeneration
immigrants and girls are graded worse in math than comparable natives and boys,
respectively. Once all grading-relevant characteristics, namely math skills and oral participation,
are accounted for, pupils should obtain same school grades. Results of a matching approach
and class fixed effects regressions suggest that second-generation immigrants have
grade disadvantages in primary education which could bias their secondary school track
choice. Regarding secondary school, most immigrants are not affected by grade discrimination
and girls enrolled in upper-secondary school are systematically graded better.
