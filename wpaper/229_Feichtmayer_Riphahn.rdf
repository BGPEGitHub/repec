Title: Intergenerational Transmission of Welfare Benefit Receipt: Evidence from Germany
	
Abstract: We study the intergenerational transmission of welfare benefit receipt in Germany. We first describe the correlation between welfare receipt experienced in the parental household and
subsequent own welfare receipt of young adults. In a second step, we investigate whether the
observed correlations reflect causal effects of past welfare experience. We use family fixed
effects estimations and Gottschalk's (1996) approach and take advantage of the long-running
German Socio-Economic Panel Survey to contribute to a sparse literature. We find strong
positive correlations between parental and own welfare receipt. These patterns do, however,
not persist after controlling for unobserved heterogeneities. Therefore, our results suggest that the strong intergenerational correlation of welfare benefit receipt is determined by family
background rather than by the experience of parental welfare benefit receipt.
