Title: Good Intentions Pave the Way to ... the Local Moneylender
	
Abstract: Microborrowers may take usurious loans to repay a loan taken from a micronance institution
because of having neglected the time inconsistency of optimal plans or having discounted future payoffs 
too strongly from the ex-post perspective. Microfinance programs should strive at
preventing such consequences of bounded rationality.
