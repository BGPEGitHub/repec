Title: Works Councils and Separations: Voice, Monopoly, and Insurance Effects

Abstract: Using a large linked employer-employee data set for Germany, we find
that the existence of a works council is associated with a lower separation rate to
employment, in particular for men and workers with low tenure. While works council
monopoly effects show up in all specifications, clear voice effects are only visible for
low tenured workers. Works councils also reduce separations to non-employment,
and this impact is more pronounced for men. Insurance effects only show up for
workers with tenure of more than one year. Our results indicate that works councils
primarily represent the interests of a specific clientele.
