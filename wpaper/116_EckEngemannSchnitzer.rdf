Title: How Trade Credits Foster International Trade
	
Abstract: Internationally active firms rely intensively on trade credits even though they are considered
particularly expensive. This phenomenon has been little explored so far. Our theoretical analysis shows that trade credits can alleviate financial constraints arising from asymmetric information because they serve as a quality signal and reduce the uncertainty
related to international transactions. We use unique survey data on German enterprises to test the effect of the use of trade credits on firms' exporting and importing behavior, both at the extensive and intensive margins. Our results support the
assertion that trade credits have a positive impact on firms' exporting and importing activities.
