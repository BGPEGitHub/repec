Title: Endogenous Information and Privacy in Automobile Insurance Markets
Abstract: This paper examines the implications of insurers’ offering a voluntary monitoring technology
to insureds in automobile insurance markets with adverse selection and without
commitment. Under the consideration of the inherent costs related to the loss of privacy,
the paper analyzes the incentives of insureds to reveal information, whereby they can
decide how much or what quality of information to reveal. It is also allowed for the possibility
that high risk individuals might mimic low risk individuals. The resulting market
equilibria are characterized and it is shown, that it might be optimal for insureds to reject
the monitoring technology, but also that under certain conditions, which are specified in
the paper, it might be optimal for insureds to reveal complete information. Concerning
the welfare effects of introducing voluntary monitoring of insureds, if low risk individuals
reject it, there will be no change to either risk type. If they accept it, this will make
them better off and high risks may either be made better off or worse off depending on
the initial equilibrium before a monitoring technology is offered. Unless it is optimal for
individuals to reveal either zero or complete information, an all-or-nothing nature of the
monitoring technology will not be efficient.
