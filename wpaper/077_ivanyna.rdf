Title: Citizen-centric governance indicators: Measuring and monitoring governance by listening to the people and not the interest groups

Abstract: Governance indicators are now widely used as tools for conducting development
dialogue, allocating external assistance and influencing foreign direct
investment. This paper argues that available governance indicators are not
suitable for these purposes as they do not conceptualize governance and fail
to capture how citizens perceive the governance environment and outcomes
in their countries. This paper attempts to fill this void by conceptualizing
governance and implementing a uniform and consistent framework for measuring
governance quality across countries and over time based upon citizens’
evaluations.
