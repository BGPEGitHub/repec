Title: Big Data and Start-up Performance
	
Abstract: Big Data (BD) is becoming widely available and manageable. This raises the question
of whether Big Data Analytics (BDA) in companies leads to better decision-making and
hence performance. Based on a large, representative set of start-ups in Germany, we study
the adoption of BDA among small and young ventures and analyze its economic effects
using various short- and longer-term performance measures. We investigate the effect of
adopting BDA on the new venturesâ€™ cost structure, sales, profits, survival rate, growth, and
their probability of receiving Venture Capital (VC) financing while taking into account fac-
tors that drive BDA adoption. Our findings, however, show that using BDA does not lead
to an immediate competitive advantage in terms of the classical short-term performance
measures. BDA adoption is rather associated with greater sales/profit uncertainty, higher
(personnel) costs, and a higher probability of failure. Yet, the increased risk of adopt-
ing BDA is compensated by a prospect of higher long-term performance conditional on
survival. BDA-adopting start-ups perform better than comparable ones when considering
longer-term performance measures such as their growth and their ability to secure VC.
