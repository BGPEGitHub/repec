Title: Public child care and mothers’ career trajectories
	
Abstract: We study the impact of public child care on mothers’ career trajectories, focusing
on qualitative dimensions of career choices. Using an event study approach, we
find that child care helps mothers to return to the labor market more quickly and
that this effect is mainly due to an increase in part-time employment. At the same
time, we find no short- or long-term effects of child care on the quality of maternal
careers, as measured, for example, by employment stability, employment in occu-
pations with abstract tasks, or employment in managerial positions. Furthermore,
we find no evidence of heterogeneous effects across mothers.
