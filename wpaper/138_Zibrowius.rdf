Title: Ethnic background and youth unemployment in Germany

	
Abstract: The empirical literature has shown on numerous occasions that immigrants and their offspring
fare worse economically than natives with comparable observable characteristics. This study
addresses youth unemployment as an important determinant of youths’ later labor market
success by looking at the determinants of the hazard of first unemployment after age 17, when
compulsory schooling is over. Proportional hazard models show no evidence for a statistically
significantly higher risk of becoming unemployed for both first and second generation
immigrants compared to natives. However, further differentiating by ethnic background,
hazard rates are significantly higher for individuals with Turkish origin compared to
Germans, ceteris paribus. These differences vanish only party when controlling for individual,
family, and regional characteristics, they differ by gender and immigrant generation, and they
are particularly strong for longer unemployment spells.
