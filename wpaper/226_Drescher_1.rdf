Title: When Weather Wounds Workers: The Impact of Temperature on Workplace Accidents
	
Abstract: We study the effects of temperature on occupational health using administrative
data on Swiss occupational accidents from 1996 to 2019. Our results imply that on
hot days (Tmax ≥30◦C) the number of occupational accidents increases by 7.4% and
on ice days (Tmax < 0◦C) by 6.3%, relative to mild days. We find that extreme
temperatures cause an average of 2,600 workplace accidents each year, accounting for
1% of annual accidents. We provide suggestive evidence for insufficient sleep on hot
days as a mechanism. While extreme temperatures worsen occupational health, we
observe limited labor supply adaption for most workers.
