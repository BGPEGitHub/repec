Title: "Labor Supply and Automation Innovation"

	
Abstract: While economic theory suggests substitutability between labor and capital, little evidence exists regarding the causal effect of labor supply on inventing labor-saving technologies. We analyze the impact
of exogenous changes in regional labor supply on automation innovation by exploiting an immigrant
placement policy in Germany during the 1990s and 2000s. Difference-in-differences estimates indicate
that one additional worker per 1,000 manual and unskilled workers reduces automation innovation
by 0.05 patents. The effect is most pronounced two years after immigration and confined to industries
containing many low-skilled workers. Labor market tightness and external demand are plausible mechanisms for the labor-innovation nexus.
