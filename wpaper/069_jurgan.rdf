Title: Cost Variations in a Differentiated Good Oligopoly

Abstract: In the homogenous good case, the relationship between market struc-
ture and efficiency was studied extensively. Assuming a standard quadratic
utility with quantity competition, this paper carries on the analysis in a
differentiated good context. It can be shown that there is a positive re-
lationship between market heterogeneity and efficiency, too. In contrast
to the homogenous good case, consumer surplus as well as producer
surplus increases with the dispersion of marginal costs.
