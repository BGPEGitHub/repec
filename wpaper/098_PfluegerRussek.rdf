Title: Business Conditions and Default Risks Across Countries

	
Abstract: The risk of default that business firms face is very significant and differs widely across
countries. This paper explores the links between countries’ business conditions and international
trade embedment and the default risk at the country level from a theoretical point of view. Our
main contribution is to set up a general equilibrium model which allows us to derive sharp
predictions concerning how key factors which shape a country’s business and trade environment
impact on the default risk of firms which operate in these environments. The predictions are in
accord with readily available data.
