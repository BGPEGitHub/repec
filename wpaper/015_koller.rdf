Title: Schwellenwerte im Arbeitsrecht: Höhere Transparenz und Effizienz durch Vereinheitlichung
Abstract: In Germany, many labour laws and regulations apply only in establishments
above a critical size, and usually these thresholds are defined by the
number of employees. The existing 160 thresholds are complex and defined inconsistently,
making it difficult for firms to obey the law. Moreover, exceeding a threshold
may result in costs for the firm such as establishing a works council or paying
a penalty for not employing disabled persons. Although the empirical evidence is
mixed, some studies suggest that employment growth is dampened by firms avoiding
to exceed thresholds. In order to minimize these transaction costs and side
effects, we make several suggestions to simplify and unify the threshold regulations.
