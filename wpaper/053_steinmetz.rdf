Title: 	Competition, Innovation and the Effect of Knowledge Accumulation
	
Abstract: The question this paper addresses is how the market structure evolves due to
innovative activities when firms' level of technological competence is valuable for
more than one project. The focus of the work is the analysis of the effect of learning-
by-doing and organizational forgetting in R&D on firms' incentives to innovate. I
develop a dynamic step by step innovation model with history dependency. Firms can
accumulate knowledge by investing in R&D. As a benchmark I show that without
knowledge accumulation the leader's R&D effort increases with the gap as she is
trying to avoid competition in the future. When firms gain experience by performing
R&D the resulting effect of knowledge induces technological leaders to rest on their
laurels which allows followers to catch up. Contrary to the benchmark case, the
leader's innovation effort declines with the lead. This causes an equilibrium where
the incentives to innovate are highest when competition is most intense.
