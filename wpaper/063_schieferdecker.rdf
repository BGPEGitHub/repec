Title: The Transition to Tertiary Education and Parental Background over Time
	
Abstract: Using SOEP data (1984-2006) we analyze the role of parental background for transitions to
tertiary education in Germany and answer three questions: (a) does the relevance of parental
background shift from short-term (contemporary income) to long factors (ability, parental
education) at higher levels of education? (b) Did the impact of parental background on
participation in tertiary education change over time? (c) Are there different patterns by sex
and region? We consider panel estimators with and without selectivity corrections and
numerous robustness tests. Parental income significantly affects transitions to tertiary
education. Its impact seems to have lost magnitude over time. We find no clear differences by
sex, and larger parental income effects in West than in East Germany.
