Title: How to get tenured

Abstract: Getting a tenured position in economics in Germany is viewed as a random
outcome where the probability of tenure depends on the quantity and qual-
ity of publications, age and years since PhD. We measure publications both
in units of Top 5 journals and in units of the European Economic Review
(EER). We find that the average age of a professor in the year of his first
appointment in Germany in the period of 1970 to 2005 is 38. This is ap-
proximately 8 years after the PhD. He has 1.5 "standardized" Top 5 papers
or 2.2 "standardized" EER papers, i.e. written with one coauthor and of 20
pages length. Results vary across subfields and over time. Someone aiming
for a tenured job after 2010 should by then (average over all fields) have
3.3 standardized Top 5 papers or 5 standardized EER papers.
