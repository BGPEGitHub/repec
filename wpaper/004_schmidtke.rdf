Title:  Private Provision of a Complementary Public Good
Abstract: For several years, an increasing number of ¯rms are investing in
Open Source Software (OSS). While improvements in such a non-
excludable public good cannot be appropriated, companies can bene¯t
indirectly in a complementary proprietary segment. We study this
incentive for investment in OSS. In particular we ask how (1) market
entry and (2) public investments in the public good a®ects the ¯rms'
production and pro¯ts. Surprisingly, we ¯nd that there exist cases
where incumbents bene¯t from market entry. Moreover, we show the
counter-intuitive result that public spending does not necessarily lead
to a decreasing voluntary private contribution.
