Title: Do community needs affect the decision to volunteer? The case of refugees in Germany.
	
Abstract: I study the relationship between changes in community needs and the supply of voluntary work.
I present basic theoretical considerations, which suggest that the relationship between voluntary
work and an increase in community needs is ambiguous. Then, I test the relationship empirically
by proxying community needs with the number of needy people, i.e., refugees, in a county, and
by exploiting the quasi-experiment of refugeesâ€™ allocation within Germany. I find that doubling
the number of refugees increases the probability of volunteering by about 2 percentage points.
These estimates imply that 1.45 million people additionally volunteered during the refugee crisis,
i.e., more than one person per refugee.
