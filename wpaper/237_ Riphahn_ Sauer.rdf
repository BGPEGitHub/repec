Title: Earnings Assimilation of Post-reunification East German Migrants in West Germany
	
Abstract: We investigate the wage assimilation of East Germans who migrated to West Germany after
reunification (1990-1999). We compare their wage assimilation to that of ethnic German
immigrants from Eastern Bloc countries and international immigrants to West Germany who
arrived at the same time. The analysis uses administrative as well as survey data. The results
suggest that East Germans faced significant initial earnings disadvantages in West Germany,
even conditional on age and education. However, these disadvantages were smaller than those
of international immigrants, supporting the beneficial role of cultural similarity. The earnings
gap relative to West German natives narrowed over time for all immigrants. These findings are
robust to controlling for potentially endogenous return migration and labor force participation.
Controls for fixed effects reveal that positive assimilation for East German and international
immigrants was concentrated among highly educated immigrants.
