Title: New Combinations and Growth
Abstract: This paper develops an endogenous growth model based on the idea of new
combinations of input factors as a growth mechanism. The model integrates
the idea of several technologies used simultaneously in producing final output.
Innovations are of the horizontal and vertical type and in addition of the type of
new technologies which can be combined with existing ones. All types of innovations
are endogenous and the occurrence of a new technology has stochastic
elements as well. This leads to endogenous dynamics in growth rates of final
output production.
