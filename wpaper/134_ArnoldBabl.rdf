Title: Alas, My Home is My Castle: The Excessive Screening Cost of Buying a House

	
Abstract: This paper analyzes a model in which housing tenure choice serves as a means of screening
households with different utilization rates. If the proportion of low-utilization types is small,
there is a separating equilibrium at which tenure choice acts as a screening device: consistent
with empirical evidence, low-utilization households buy a house, while high-utilization types
rent. Otherwise, there is a pooling equilibrium. The reason why, contrary to standard screening
models, a pooling equilibrium possibly exists is indivisibility of home ownership, which makes
it a very costly screening device. Introducing partial ownership restores the standard results:
non-existence of a pooling equilibrium and possible non-existence of an equilibrium. The same
mechanisms are at work in a corporate finance context.
