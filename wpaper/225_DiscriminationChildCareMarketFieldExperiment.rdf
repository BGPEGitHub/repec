Title: Discrimination on the Child Care Market: 
	A Nationwide Field Experiment
	
Abstract: We provide the first causal evidence of discrimination against migrants seeking child care. We send
emails from fictitious parents to > 18, 000 early child care centers across Germany, asking if there is a
slot available and how to apply. Randomly varying names to signal migration background, we find that
migrants receive 4.4 percentage points fewer responses. Responses to migrants also contain substantially
fewer slot oﬀers, are shorter, and less encouraging. Exploring channels, discrimination against migrants
does not diﬀer by the perceived educational background of the email sender. However, it does diﬀer
by regional characteristics, being stronger in areas with lower shares of migrants in child care, higher
right-wing vote shares, and lower financial resources. Discrimination on the child care market likely
perpetuates existing inequalities of opportunities for disadvantaged children.
