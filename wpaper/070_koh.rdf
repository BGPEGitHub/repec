Title: Inefficient lock-in and subsidy competition

Abstract: This paper shows that subsidy competition may be efficiency enhancing. We
model a subsidy game among two asymmetric regions in a new trade model, where
capital can freely move among regions, but capital rewards are repatriated. We study
subsidy competition, starting from an equilibrium where the industry core is ineffi-
ciently locked in to the smaller region. When regions weigh workers' and capitalists'
welfare equally, the core region will set its subsidy low enough that the industry re-
locates to the larger region, restoring an efficient allocation. When workers' welfare
is weighted more heavily, the core may pay subsidies that are high enough to prevent
a relocation of industry.
