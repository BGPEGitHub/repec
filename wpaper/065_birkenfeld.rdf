Title: What makes up a central exit examination?
	
Abstract: A large number of econometric studies have examined the impact of
central exit examinations on student attainment and repeatedly found
a positive effect. This paper contributes to clarify the term central exit
examination by distinguishing between central assignment and central
grading. For this purpose, I use a study from Birkenfeld und Hanafy
(2008), who have gathered the relevant information for the 16 German
federal states. First econonometric analyses show, that the distinction
between central assignment and central grading is indeed fruitful.
