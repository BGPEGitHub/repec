Title: Modelling the folk theorem of spatial economics: a heterogeneous regional growth model

Abstract: During the last year, the research field of spatial economic has rapidly increased.
There is consensus that the economic performance of a region depends not only on its
own potential, but also on the development of their neighbouring regions. Knowledge
spillovers, which are non constant over space, should influence the evolution of the
region specific productivity. The so called "folk theorem of spatial economics" states,
that increasing returns to scale are essential for explaining the uneven economic distri-
bution of specific economic activity, which implies that knowledge spillover, agglom-
eration and distribution of per capita productivity are closely linked. Thus, the aim
of this paper is, to introduce a spatial regional growth model, which links first time
knowledge spillover, agglomeration, distribution of per capita productivity and the
grasp of spillovers. Further, it is shown in a simulation study, how different regimes of
returns to scale and grasps of knowledge affect agglomeration and distribution of per
capita productivity. One of key findings is, that grasp of knowledge affects dynamic
distribution of per capita productivity. Moreover, the simulation study particularly
finds support for the "folk theorem of spatial economics".
