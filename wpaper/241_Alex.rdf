Title: Risk of Bankruptcy and the Modigliani-Miller theorem in a General Equilibrium model of Socially Responsible Investing
	
Abstract: In the SRI-augmented version of the Arrow-Debreu-model by Arnold (2023), the restriction to no risk of bankruptcy is immaterial. Furthermore, shareholder unanimity is still valid when a firmâ€™s bond issuance (viz., its leverage) is chosen endogenously. The debt-equity-ratio of firms may not only be set arbitrarily (independent of their capital choice) with respect
to shareholder value, but also to entire budget sets, implying an economy-wide Modigliani-Miller type of irrelevance given market completeness. If SRI leads individuals to constrain the set of assets they are prepared to buy and, thus, reduces their personal marketed subspace, over-indebtedness may restore it.
