Title: A Reconsideration of the Stiglitz-Weiss Model with a Discrete Number of Borrower Types

Abstract: In this paper we show that the equilibrium in the Stiglitz-Weiss model (Stiglitz and
Weiss, 1981) is a two-interest rate equilibrium. For this we use the true return-function
for banks shown by Arnold (2005), the assumption of Bertrand competition and make
a consideration for a discrete number of borrowers. Rationing only affects one group of
the borrowers, i.e. the borrowers with a safe project. The risky group always receives
the funds it demands.
