Title: Present Bias in Choices over Food and Money
	
Abstract: This paper investigates time inconsistencies in food consumption based on a
field experiment at a college canteen where participants repeatedly select and con-
sume lunch menus. The design features a convex non-monetary budget in a natu-
ral environment and satisfies the consume-on-receipt assumption. Leveraging 3,666
choices of different food healthiness, we find no time inconsistency at the meal level.
Utility weight estimates at the dish level reveal that consumers balance healthiness
between food categories. Individuals who exert self-control take up a commitment
device as soon as available, while non-committers are present-biased. Dynamic
inconsistencies in food and money choices are independent.
