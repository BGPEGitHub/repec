Title: The Effect of University Openings on Local Human Capital Formation: Difference-in-Differences Evidence from Germany
	
Abstract: Between 1960 and 1979, 93 new universities opened in Germany. Using this large tertiary
education expansion, I estimate the effect of a university opening on the probability of
obtaining a university degree in the local population. I exploit the geographical variation in
local university access in a difference-in-differences approach by comparing age cohorts in
counties that were and were not affected by the opening. Results show that a new university
increases the share of university graduates in a county by 8 to 10 percentage points. The effect
seems to be mainly driven my females and immigrants.
