Title: Hyperbolic Discounting and Politics: The beneficial effects of bureaucrats
Abstract: This paper introduces hyperbolic discounting into politics. In our model,
politicians act according to the preferences of voters in order to be re-elected.
As voters' preferences are dynamically inconsistent, the political process results
in an allocation of the public budget that is distorted towards consumption ex-
penditures. We show that this inefficiency is mitigated when the influence of
bureaucrats who favour an excessive supply of public goods is taken into ac-
count. Finally, we derive a positive relationship between the optimal level of a
bureaucracy's influence and the relevance of long-term investments in a given
policy area.
