Title: Project risk neutrality in the context of asymmetric information
	
Abstract: Using the modelling framework of Stiglitz & Weiss (1981), we show that
– perhaps surprisingly – there is no influence of projects’ riskiness on the
capital market equilibrium. The savings interest rate fully determines the
amount of credit rationing and the nature of an equilibrium (adverse selection, two-prices etc.). This rate is, in turn, fully determined by the relative
probabilities of success of firms’ projects (and, thus, repayment of their
debt). Hence, making capital markets overall “less risky”, which may for
example be the case when financial markets become greener, does not alle-
viate concerns of asymmetric information. The result holds both for cases
of hidden information and for those of hidden actions.
