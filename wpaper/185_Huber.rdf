Title: The role of the career costs of children for the effect of public child care on fertility and maternal employment
	
Abstract: This paper investigates whether the effects of affordable and easily available public child care on fertility and maternal employment depend on the career costs of children a woman faces. It builds on the idea that these costs vary by occupation and education. In a generalized
Diff-in-Diff, I exploit the substantial variation between West German counties concerning intensity and speed of the provision of new child care slots for under-three-year-olds. The combination of county-level data on child care coverage with detailed individual-level information from the German social security records allows me to analyze so far unexplored effect heterogeneities by occupational groups. The results indicate that the average positive effects on fertility and maternal employment are driven by women who face relatively higher career costs of children: women in occupations with a steeper age-earnings profile, women who cannot be
easily substituted at work and women with medium and high education level. The findings reveal that policies which reconcile family and work life are indeed more beneficial for women facing higher career costs of having children.
