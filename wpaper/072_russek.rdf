Title: Differential labor mobility, agglomeration, and skill-biased migration policies

Abstract: The paper analyzes the impact of skill-biased migration policies under the economics
of agglomeration. It therefore develops an agglomeration model with two
types of mobile worker who are heterogeneous and differ both within and between
skill groups with respect to their migration propensity. On the one hand, the model
reveals that the effectiveness of migration policies depends on the level on trade
costs. On the other hand, it shows that increasing (reducing) political barriers to
migration for one factor of production, reduces (increases) the migration incentive
of the other. Consequently, pro-skilled and contra-unskilled migration policies attenuate
each other or can even be counterproductive.
