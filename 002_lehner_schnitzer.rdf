Title:  Entry of Foreign Banks and their Impact on Host Countries
Abstract: Foreign bank entry is frequently associated with spillover e반cts for local
banks and increasing competition in the local banking market. We study
the impact of these e반cts on host countries. In particular, we ask how
these e반cts interact and how they depend on the competitive environment
of the host banking market. An increasing number of banks is more likely to
have positive welfare e반cts the more competitive the market environment,
whereas spillovers are less likely to have positive welfare e반cts the stronger
competition. Hence, competitive e반cts seem to reinforce each other, while
spillovers and competition tend to weaken each other.
