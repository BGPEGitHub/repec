Title:  Two–Sided Markets with Pecuniary and Participation Externalities
Abstract: The existing literature on "two-sided markets" addresses partici-
pation externalities, but so far it has neglected pecuniary externalities
between competing platforms. In this paper we build a model that
incorporates both externalities. In our setup di®erentiated platforms
compete in advertising and o®er consumers a service free of charge
(such as a TV program) that is ¯nanced through advertising. We show
that advertising can exhibit the properties of a strategic substitute or
complement. Surprisingly, there exist cases in which platforms bene¯t
from market entry. Moreover, we show that from a welfare point of
view perfect competition is not always desirable.
